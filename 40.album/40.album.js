// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds an Object describing a music album.

// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album.
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the album’s Object.
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
